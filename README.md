PIMP-my-PLiHD-by-talbs
======================

Configurable skin based on PLiHD for OpenPLi image

This skin was mainly inspired by the MyMetrix skin (for colors and configuration plugin, credits go to original author iMaxxx).
 
With this skin you can customize:
 
- Main color (20 choices of color, taken from MyMetrix, again thank you even if some colors are ugly :lol: )
- Selection bar color: Black (with colored text) or Main Color (with white text).
- Picon size (normal or SHD/Xpicon)
- Weather configuration (also taken from MyMetrix)
- Font selection : 8 fonts available including on Custom font that can be used to test your own font.
    o do so, rename your font as Custom.ttf and overwrite the Custom.ttf font in 
    /usr/share/enigma2/PIMP-my-PLiHD-by-talbs/fonts/ folder.
 
 
Also:
- This is my first plugin in python (even if i didn't had to do it from scratch) so if you have any comment on how to optimze it you're welcome.
- Better configure SNR in % and not dB in the infobar when using bold fonts. (otherwise if a HD channel is played, the screen size will cover up the SNR in dB).
- This skin is about 3Mb (mainly due to fonts).
- Thank you for your feedback.
